1) During this week, I updated the intellij to a newest version. However, during the update, all the settings are gone and I cannot figure it out how to get it back to work normally.
So I went online and did all the resettings to make it work normally.
2) my boyfriend get super sick this week so I need to take good care of him to make him recover faster.
